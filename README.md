# ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup and Execution

To set up the **SpendWise Expense Tracking Application** on your local machine, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, download the project files to your local environment by cloning the GitHub repository. This creates a local copy of the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpendWise.git
cd SpendWise
```
2. Install Dependencies
After navigating to the project directory, install all the dependencies. These include ReactJS and other supporting packages specified in package.json. The following command will download and install all required modules.
```bash
npm install
```
3. Set Up Environment (Optional)
If the project has environment-specific variables (e.g., for storing sensitive keys or configuration options), create a .env file in the root directory. Currently, this is optional but recommended for future scalability.

4. Run the Application
To launch the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```
The npm start command initiates the development server, usually running on port 3000, and opens the application in your default browser.

http://localhost:3000
This link opens the SpendWise app, where you can interact with its features, such as adding and tracking expenses.
